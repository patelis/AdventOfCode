# Day 7: The Treachery of Whales

Solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7

```{r data}

path <- "2021/data/data_day7.txt"

data <- as.numeric(strsplit(readLines(path), split = ",")[[1]])

```

## Part 1

```{r part1}

# Part 1

min_travel <- function(x, vec) {
  
  diff <- abs(vec - x)
  
  sum(diff)
  
}

xmin_part1 <- optimize(min_travel, interval = c(min(data), max(data)), vec = data)
xmin_part1$objective
# 357353

```

## Part 2

```{r part2}

# Part 2

tictoc::tic()

min_fuel_consumption <- function(x, vec) {
  
  diff <- abs(vec - ceiling(x))
  
  fuel <- sapply(diff, FUN = \(x) x * (x + 1) / 2)
  
  sum(fuel)

}

xmin_part2 <- optimize(min_fuel_consumption, interval = c(min(data), max(data)), vec = data)
xmin_part2$objective
# 104822130

tictoc::toc()
